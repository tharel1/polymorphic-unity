# Polymorphic Unity

Unity inspector lack on polymorphism support. This library allow you to define all the children class of a base class. The inspector will serialize their fields dynamically depending on the currently choosen one.

:white_check_mark: Supports :
* Concrete base class, abstract base class and base interface.
* MonoBehavior and ScriptableObject inspectors.
* Nested polymorphic objects.
* List of polymorphic objects.
* Singletons

:x: Does not support :
* Array, Dictionnary, Queue or Set of polymorphic objects.

## Installation

Copy files from __Assets/Editor/Plugins/PolymorphicUnity__ into your __Assets/Editor/Plugins/PolymorphicUnity__ path of your project.

Then, copy files from __Assets/Scripts/Plugins/PolymorphicUnity__ into your __Assets/Scripts/Plugins/PolymorphicUnity__ path of your project.

## Usage

### Define childrens

You can define some children for your Foo class as follows :

```csharp
[Serializable]
[Polymorphic(
    typeof(Foo),
    typeof(Foo1),
    typeof(Foo2)
)]
public class Foo : IPolymorphic
{
    [SerializeField]
    private int field1;
    public int Field1 { get => field1; }

    [SerializeField]
    private string field2;
    public string Field2 { get => field2; }
}

public class Foo1 : Foo
{
    [SerializeField]
    private string field3;
    public string Field3 { get => field3; }
}

public class Foo2 : Foo
{
    [SerializeField]
    private string field4;
    public string Field4 { get => field4; }
}
```
The base class Foo must be ```[Serializable]``` and implement the ```IPolymorphic``` interface.

Then, to define available childrens for your Foo class, you have to add the ```Polymorphic``` attribute with the right types in it. In this example, types are Foo, Foo1 and Foo2.

### Use in inspector

To use the polymorphic class Foo in your inspector (MonoBehavior for instance), you have to declare it as follows :

```csharp
public class MonoBehaviorExample : MonoBehaviour
{
   [SerializeReference]
   public Foo singleFoo = new Foo();
}
```

You MUST add the ```[SerializeReference]``` attribute to your declaration to be able to use polymorphism.

It is also advised to initialize by default your field to prevent some bugs related to the ```[SerializeReference]``` attribute. In this example, singleFoo is initialized by default to ```new Foo()```.

You can see the following serialized object in your inspector :

You can choose the type you want to serialize using the dropdown :

![missing image](https://github.com/Mabbutnem/polymorphic-unity/blob/images/dropdown.png?raw=true)

### List in inspector

You can also use a polymorphic list as follows :

```csharp
public class MonoBehaviorExample : MonoBehaviour
{
   [SerializeReference]
   public List<Foo> manyFoos = new List<Foo>();
}
```
:warning: Warning ! The ```[SerializeReference]``` attribute in List brings an unwanted behavior. The reference of the nearest top object will be used when adding new element to a list.

Before playing with his fields, be sure to click on the dropdown child selector to create a new instance of this object.

## Advanced usage

### Data resilience

If you want your common fields to be saved between each selection in the inspector, you can implement the following pattern :

```csharp
[Serializable]
[Polymorphic(
    typeof(Foo),
    typeof(Foo1),
    typeof(Foo2)
)]
public class Foo : IPolymorphic<Foo>
{
    // Fields ommited...
    
    public Foo ConvertPolymorph(Foo t)
    {
        t.field1 = field1;
        t.field2 = field2;
        return t;
    }
}
```

You have to implement ```IPolymophic<YourBaseClass>``` instead of ```IPolymorphic```. In your ```ConvertPolymorph``` method, you have to initialize the fields of your new created object with the current one and return it.

### Factories

Polymorphic Unity uses the default constructor of your classes to create objects. If you want to use a different strategy to initialize your object, you can use the factory pattern :

```csharp
// Base class ommited...

[PolymorphFactory(typeof(Foo1Factory))]
public class Foo1 : Foo
{
    // Singleton
    private Foo1() { }
    public static Foo1 Instance { get; } = new Foo1();
}

public class Foo1Factory : IPolymorphFactory<Foo1>
{
    public Foo1 CreatePolymorph()
    {
       return Foo1.Instance;
    }
}
```

The factory pattern is particularly useful when you want one of your child to be a Singleton. In this example, the Foo1 class will share the same instance in all the application.

You have to set a ```[PolymorphFactory]``` to your child and specify the factory type you want to use. Then, you create a factory class that implement the interface ```IPolymorphFactory<YourChildClass>```. Finally, you implement the method ```CreatePolymorph``` according to your needs.
